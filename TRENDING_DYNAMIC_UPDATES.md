# Trending Page - Dynamic Date & Results Accuracy

## ✅ Dynamic Date System

Your trending page **automatically updates** every day with accurate, real-time results from GitHub. Here's how it works:

### 🕒 How Dates Are Calculated

The system uses **server-side UTC time** to calculate date ranges dynamically:

```typescript
function getDateRange(since: string): string {
  const now = new Date(); // ⬅️ Gets CURRENT time on each request
  
  switch (since) {
    case 'daily':
      date = new Date(now.getTime() - 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);  // Last 24 hours
    case 'weekly':
      date = new Date(now.getTime() - 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);  // Last 7 days
    case 'monthly':
      date = new Date(now.getTime() - 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // Last 30 days
  }
  
  return date.toISOString().split('T')[0]; // Returns: YYYY-MM-DD
}
```

### 📊 Timeline Examples

**If today is October 21, 2025:**
- **Daily**: Shows repos from October 20, 2025 → October 21, 2025
- **Weekly**: Shows repos from October 14, 2025 → October 21, 2025
- **Monthly**: Shows repos from September 21, 2025 → October 21, 2025

**If tomorrow is October 22, 2025:**
- **Daily**: Shows repos from October 21, 2025 → October 22, 2025 ✨ (automatically updated)
- **Weekly**: Shows repos from October 15, 2025 → October 22, 2025 ✨ (automatically updated)
- **Monthly**: Shows repos from September 22, 2025 → October 22, 2025 ✨ (automatically updated)

## 🎯 Result Accuracy

### Real-Time GitHub Data
The API fetches **live data** from GitHub on every request:

```typescript
// Query 1: Recently updated repos (last N days)
const query1 = `pushed:>=${dateRange} stars:>=10`;

// Query 2: Recently created repos (last N days)
const query2 = `created:>=${dateRange} stars:>=5`;
```

### Multi-Strategy Approach
1. **Recently Updated**: Repos pushed in the date range with good star counts
2. **Recently Created**: New repos created in the date range gaining traction
3. **Combined Results**: Deduplicates and merges both strategies

### Statistical Trending Detection (Z-Score Algorithm)
The system uses advanced statistics to identify **truly trending** repos:

```
Z-Score Formula: z = (x - μ) / σ
- x = repository's trending score
- μ = mean score of all repos
- σ = standard deviation

Ranking System:
- z > 1.5  → Highly trending (major boost)
- z > 0.5  → Moderately trending (moderate boost)
- z > 0    → Slightly trending (small boost)
- z ≤ 0    → Not trending (penalty applied)
```

### Trending Score Calculation
Each repository gets a score based on:

1. **Stars Velocity**: `stars / age_in_days`
   - Measures growth rate, not just total stars
   - New repos with rapid growth score higher

2. **Recent Activity Multiplier**:
   - Recent pushes boost score
   - Recent updates boost score
   - Inactive repos get penalized

3. **Engagement Ratio**:
   - `(forks + watchers) / stars`
   - High engagement indicates real interest

4. **Age-Based Weighting**:
   - < 30 days: 2.0x multiplier
   - < 90 days: 1.5x multiplier
   - Older: 1.0x multiplier

## 🔄 Data Freshness

### Cache Strategy
```typescript
Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=300, stale-while-revalidate=600
```

- **Fresh for 5 minutes**: Multiple requests within 5 min get cached data
- **Revalidates after 5 min**: Gets new data from GitHub
- **Stale-while-revalidate**: Shows cached data while fetching new data in background

This ensures:
- ✅ Fast response times
- ✅ Always up-to-date results (max 5 min old)
- ✅ No unnecessary GitHub API calls

### Response Metadata
Every response includes metadata for verification:

```json
{
  "items": [...],
  "generated_at": "2025-10-21T14:30:00.000Z",  // When data was fetched
  "date_range": {
    "since": "daily",
    "from_date": "2025-10-20",  // Start of range
    "to_date": "2025-10-21"     // End of range (today)
  }
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Dynamic Updates

### Method 1: Check Response Metadata
Open browser DevTools → Network tab → Select API call → Check response:
```json
{
  "generated_at": "2025-10-21T14:30:00.000Z",
  "date_range": {
    "from_date": "2025-10-20",
    "to_date": "2025-10-21"
  }
}
```

### Method 2: Compare Results Over Time
1. Note the top 5 repos today
2. Check again tomorrow
3. Results should change based on new GitHub activity

### Method 3: Test Different Time Periods
1. Select "Today" → See today's trending
2. Select "This week" → See last 7 days
3. Select "This month" → See last 30 days

Each should show different repos based on the timeframe.

## 🔍 Debug Mode (Development)

In development mode, responses include detailed analytics:

```json
{
  "debug": {
    "algorithm": "Z-score based trending detection",
    "dataset_stats": {
      "total_repos": 30,
      "mean_z_score": "0.000",
      "positive_z_count": 15,
      "highly_trending_count": 3
    },
    "top_results": [
      {
        "name": "owner/repo",
        "z_score": "2.15",
        "stars_velocity": "45.2",
        "stars": 1250,
        "age_days": 28,
        "final_score": "147.850"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
