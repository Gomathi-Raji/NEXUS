## 🎯 Theme Consistency

The page now matches the design patterns from:
- `/search` page - Glassmorphism and golden accents
- `/opensource` page - Card layouts and hover effects
- `/` (home) - Background gradients and typography

### Key Patterns Implemented:
✅ `bg-black/30 backdrop-blur-2xl` - Glass cards
✅ `border-white/20` → `border-white/30` on hover
✅ `text-golden-400` → `text-golden-300` on hover  
✅ `bg-gradient-to-br from-white/5...` - Glass overlays
✅ `shadow-lg hover:shadow-golden-500/10` - Glow effects
✅ `ring-white/10 hover:ring-golden-500/50` - Avatar rings
